# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning. It is created as part of the CODSOFT Data Science Internship.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes real-world credit card transactions, with features already anonymized using PCA. Only a small percentage of the data is fraudulent.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 ML Algorithm Used
- Logistic Regression

## ⚖️ Handling Imbalanced Data
- Applied under-sampling to handle class imbalance (fraud vs. non-fraud)

## 🧪 Model Evaluation
- Accuracy score
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Load the notebook in Colab or Jupyter
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. View the model output and evaluation results
